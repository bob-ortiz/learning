# Principles
1. First try to get across the major idea: **do not get stuck in the *details* ** (they will come later)
2. Solve problems (**test yourself**): Large part of learning is problem solving (make mistakes)
3. Go back and forth between different things: do not get stuck in one thing over and over agian
4. Set aside to **fully study** something and some time to **freely explore it**.

# Assessment 
## Seems to work
- Switching between focused mode and diffuse mode: setting a **quitting time**.
- **Spaced repetition**: 3 correct recalls during initial learning, and relearning 3 times at widely spaced intervals
- Feynman Technique:
  1. Study X
  2. Try to teach X in the most basic way possible (without notes)
  3. Idenfity gaps in knowlede of X and go back and understand better
  4. Repeat
- Notetaking: Having my (own) notes on the topics to search for them later (e.g. 2SLS in Econometrics 2)
- Doing *more than 1 draft* when solving exercises, to be able to go over them 2 or 3 times
## Does not seem to work
- Reading tired (or without caffeine) as I end up falling asleep or not understanding anything
- Focusing on the *process* not the *product*. What exactly does that mean?
- Notetaking: writing everything down in my notebook
  - A note is a container of thought that has meaning for the person who made it.
  - Sequential notes have the limitation that they follow the teacher's logical explanation, instead of a holistic and conceptual approach.
