# Principles
1. First try to get across the major idea: **do not get stuck in the details** (they will come later)
2. Solve problems (**test yourself**): Large part of learning is problem solving (make mistakes)
3. Go back and forth between different things: do not get stuck in one thing over and over agian
4. Set aside to **fully study** something and some time to **freely explore it**.
5. **Review** notes for 5-10 minutes and catch *doubts* and *ambiguities* 
6. **L**earn, **P**resent, **C**ritique and correct errors (repeat) (and make exercises).

# Assessment 

| **Seems to work**  | **Does not seem to work** |
| --- | --- |
| Switching between focused mode and diffuse mode:  setting a **quitting time**.  | Reading tired (or without caffeine) as I end up falling asleep or not understanding anything  |
| **Spaced repetition (SR)**: 3 correct recalls during initial learning, and relearning 3 times at widely spaced intervals  | Focusing on the *process* not the *product*. What exactly does that mean?  |
| Notetaking: Having my (own) notes on the topics to search for them later (e.g. 2SLS in Econometrics 2)| Notetaking: writing everything down in my notebook - A note is a container of thought that has meaning for the person who made it. - Sequential notes have the limitation that they follow the teacher's logical explanation, instead of a holistic and conceptual approach. |
|Feynman Technique:  1. Study X 2. Try to teach X in the most basic way possible (without notes) 3. Idenfity gaps in knowlede of X and go back and understand better  4. Repeat |a|
| Doing *more than 1 draft* when solving exercises, to be able to go over them 2 or 3 times|epa|

# Experimenting
## Currently
1. Reading all the course material before the actual class
2. *Reviewing* notes and creating flash cards afterwards on most complicated topics

## Yet to experiment
- [ ] Reading all the course material before the actual class
- [ ] Plan, Preview, View (go to class), Review, Practice Test, Repeat ([How I Take 0 Notes in Medical School](https://youtu.be/CeEZJPJO474) )
- [ ] Figure out what my weakest links are (macroeconomics, time series, diminished chords) and improve them: "If the exam were tomorrow, what topic would I be the most pissed off about?
- [ ] Testing myself inside the "FLOW" area: where my knowledge/skill on the topic matches linearly the difficulty level
